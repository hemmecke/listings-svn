Request for language drivers
----------------------------

If you want a programming language to be added, the minimal
things *you* should provide are:

  1. a comma separated list of keywords, and whether they
     are case sensitive or not;

  2. optional: a comma separated list of predefined names,
     functions, and procedures;

  3. a description of the comment delimiters---for example
     "the delimiters are (* and *) and they work as /* and
     */ in C" would be enough;

  4. a description of the string delimiters;

  5. a description of special things, for example, for TeX
     this would include that digits never belong to a
     control sequence and hence don't behave like digits in
     usual programming languages.
