Abstract
--------

The `listings' package is a source code printer for LaTeX.
You can typeset stand alone files as well as listings with
an environment similar to  `verbatim' as well as you can
print code snippets using a command similar to \verb'.
Many parameters control the output and if your preferred
programming language isn't already supported, you can make
your own definition.

For more details read the documentation `listings.dvi'.


Quick Installation Guide
------------------------

1) Following the TeX directory structure (TDS), you should
   put the files of the `listings' package into directories
   as follows:

     texmf/doc/latex/listings
       listings.dvi            

     texmf/source/latex/listings (or a temporary directory)
       listings.dtx
       listings.ins
       lstdrvrs.dtx
       lstpatch.sty (if you have a patch file)

   If you don't use the TDS, adjust the directories below.

2) Create `texmf/tex/latex/listings' or remove all files
   except `lst????0.sty' and `lstlocal.cfg' from that
   directory.

3) Go to the directory `texmf/source/latex/listings' and
   run `listings.ins' through TeX or LaTeX.

4) Move all .sty and .cfg of the current directory to
   `texmf/tex/latex/listings', if this is not already done.

5) If your TeX implementation uses a filename database,
   update it.

6) If you receive a patch file later on, put it where
   `listings.sty' is (and update file name database).

Note that `listings' requires at least version 1.10 of
`keyval' included in David Carlisle's `graphics' bundle.
You can download it from

    CTAN: macros/latex/required/graphics

You'll have to run  graphics.ins  through TeX.
